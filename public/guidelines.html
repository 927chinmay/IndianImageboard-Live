            <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
            <p><strong>Our Goal:</strong> To provide a clean, safe, and engaging platform for discussion, open to everyone. To achieve this, we require all users to adhere to the following rules.</p>
            
            <hr>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Be Respectful</h3>
                    <p>Do not personally attack, threaten, harass, or insult other users. Criticize ideas, not people.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>2. No Hate Speech</h3>
                    <p>Content that promotes discrimination, bigotry, or violence against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation is strictly forbidden.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>3. No Illegal Content</h3>
                    <p>Do not post or link to anything that violates Indian law. This includes, but is not limited to, copyrighted material you don't own, and content related to illegal activities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Keep it Clean</h3>
                    <p>No posting of pornographic, excessively violent, or graphically disturbing content.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>5. No Spam or Self-Promotion</h3>
                    <p>Do not use the platform for unsolicited advertising or commercial self-promotion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>6. Respect Privacy</h3>
                    <p>Do not post the private information of any individual without their explicit consent. This is known as "doxxing" and will result in an immediate ban.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>7. Post to the Correct Board</h3>
                    <p>Please post your content in the most relevant discussion board to keep conversations organized.</p>
